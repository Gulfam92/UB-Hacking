We are very excited to participate in the UB Hacking contest organized virtually this year. As part of that, our team decided to make use of Full Stack engineering to deveop
a social media application like Instagram where users can register themselves, follow their friends, post pics or messages, like and comment on the posts etc.
During this hacking event, developing an application like this has helped us to gain knowledge of end-to-end application development in constrained time duration.
